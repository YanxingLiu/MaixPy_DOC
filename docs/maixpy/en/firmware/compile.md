The pre-compiled firmware may not meet specific usage scenarios. If you need to modify the configuration, please configure and compile the required firmware

## Native environment compilation

For the compilation method, please refer to the compilation instructions under the source code [build.md](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy/blob/master/build.md)

## Use docker environment to compile

Docker can simplify development environment installation
> If you have never used docker, please learn about docker by yourself,
> If you haven't studied before, you can think of it as similar to a virtual machine, that is, a virtual machine with a compilation environment has been prepared for you, and you can download and run it directly to compile the source code

The docker image has already packaged the environment, just pull the image and run it to start compiling, refer to [Use Docker to compile the source code](https://github.com/sipeed/MaixPy/tree/master/tools/docker)
