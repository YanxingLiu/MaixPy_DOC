Kendryte K210 is a system-on-chip (SoC) that integrates machine vision and machine hearing capabilities. It uses TSMC's ultra-low power 28-nanometer advanced manufacturing process, with dual-core 64-bit processors, and has good power consumption performance and stability And reliability. The program strives for zero-threshold development, which can be deployed in the user's products in the shortest time, giving the product artificial intelligence.

Kendryte K210 is located in the SoC of the AI ​​and IoT market, and it is also a very convenient MCU.

The Chinese meaning of Kendryte is **Kanzhi(堪智)**, and Kanzhi is derived from Geophysical Prospecting. The main application field of this chip is the Internet of Things field, and it is developed in the field of Internet of Things, so it is Prospecting; this chip mainly provides Artificial intelligence solutions are explored in the field of artificial intelligence, so they are intellectual exploration.

1.3. Hybrid vision/auditory solutions
Kendryte K210 can combine machine vision and machine hearing capabilities to provide more powerful functions. On the one hand, in the application, it can not only assist machine vision to track the target through sound source localization and sound field imaging, but also obtain the target position through general target detection. After assisting the machine hearing to perform beamforming on the position. On the other hand, the direction of the person can be obtained through the image from the camera, so that the microphone array can be directed to the person through beamforming. At the same time, the direction of a speaker can also be determined according to the microphone array , Turn the camera to point at the person.
