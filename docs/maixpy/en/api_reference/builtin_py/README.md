The `builtin_py` library (builtin_py) is a user-level interface that encapsulates the underlying classes of MaixPy, which is convenient for users to use MaixPy. It includes the following:

* [fpioa_manager](fm.md)
* [board_info](board_info.md)
* [pye](pye.md)

```python
from board import board_info
from fpioa_manager import fm
```
