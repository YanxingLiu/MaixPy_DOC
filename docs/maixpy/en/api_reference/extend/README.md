The peripheral modules here mainly refer to off-chip peripherals (as opposed to on-chip peripherals, such as GPIO, I2C, etc.), such as LCD, camera, touch screen, etc.

The image-related information is temporarily placed in the [Machine Vision](../machine_vision/README.md) category, including the following peripheral modules

* [lcd](../machine_vision/lcd.md): display image
* [sensor](../machine_vision/sensor.md): Get camera data, named `sensor` and it is compatible with `openmv`, of course it is not exactly the same, please read the document

Other peripheral modules include:

* [touchscreen](./touchscreen.md): touch screen related operations, read the touch screen click status and get the click coordinates, etc.
* [ws2812](./ws2812.md): WS2812 single bus light strip
* [Thermal infrared temperature sensor](./htpa.md)
* [Ultrasonic](./ultrasonic.md)
